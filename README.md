### 🏢  Overview

Atmajyoti is a wellness brand that aims to empower people of all age groups—children to elderly people—with powerful tools for self-transformation. With a plethora of courses and individual counseling, Atmajyoti deals with mental, emotional, and spiritual healing.

The founder, Mrs. Rma M Ketkar, had a vision of an online platform that embodies the serenity, clarity, and transformative experience her services provide. The task was to translate that vision into an easy-to-use, inviting, and conversion-driven online presence.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Create a user-friendly website with seamless navigation and soothing design.
- Emphasize courses and counseling services for a broad audience.
- Facilitate online bookings and product sales via WooCommerce integration.
- Make it mobile-friendly and load quickly.
- Stay flexible for simple content editing with Elementor.

### 💡Our Process

#### 1. Discovery & Strategy

We started with a detailed consultation with Mrs. Ketkar to grasp her goals, target audience, and the emotional impact she wanted the website to provide. The vision was obvious: a peaceful but strong platform for personal discovery and healing.

#### 2. Design & UX

Our design approach was centered on:

- A clean, light look with a minimalist design using Astra Theme for an airy, uncluttered presentation.
- Soothing color schemes and gentle animations to create an atmosphere of peace.
- Age-accessible design with clarity and usability for children as well as senior citizens.
- Visible calls-to-action (CTAs) for booking sessions and investigating courses.

#### 3. Development

We developed an extremely customizable website using WordPress and Elementor, which can easily be managed by Mrs. Ketkar's staff. WooCommerce was set up for future course registration, merchandise sales, and dissemination of resources.

#### 4. Performance & Testing

We optimized every page for:

- Mobile responsiveness
- Fast loading speeds
- SEO best practices to improve discoverability
- Security features to secure data

### Key Features Executed

- Clear value proposition Homepage
- Courses & Services section for different age groups
- About page to establish trust and highlight the founder's story

- Employing visual signals rather than jargon
- Having a standard layout throughout the pages
- Ensuring mobile usability for on-the-go accessibility
